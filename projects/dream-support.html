        </div>

        <div class="original-content-background">
            <p>The Dream Support project was developed to alleviate a critical challenge faced by social workers: the
                overwhelming
                administrative workload that hindered their ability to provide direct care. The need to repeatedly input
                case
                data across platforms led to inefficiencies and delays in providing support.
            </p>
            <p>The project stemmed from two core issues: fragmented social support programs with varying application
                requirements and the reliance on manual, paper-based processes. This made it difficult for social
                workers
                to track programs and forced them to spend hours on repetitive tasks instead of focusing on their
                clients.
            </p>
            <p>Dream Support streamlines these processes by centralizing both case and program management and
                automating tasks. With
                features like data-driven program recommendations, it also allows social workers to dedicate more focus
                to
                meaningful interventions. In its
                first phase, the platform aims to handle up to 1,000 active cases across 15 NGOs, with the potential to
                scale
                for long-term growth and greater impact.</p>

            <p>The Dream Support platform was designed with two primary goals in mind: ease of use and automation. Given
                the varied needs of social workers across multiple NGOs, it was essential to create an interface that
                was intuitive yet powerful enough to handle large volumes of data.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Case Management Module:</strong> This module organizes client information across three tabs:
                    case profiles, background details, and application records, streamlining data entry and tracking
                    progress. It also leverages the recommendation engine to suggest suitable programs based on case
                    history.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Support Program Management Module:</strong> Social workers can create and manage
                    programs in one place, generate pre-filled forms using stored client data, and keep programs
                    updated. Form automation significantly reduces repetitive administrative tasks, allowing social
                    workers to focus on client support.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="original-content-design">
            <p>The design of the Dream Support platform focuses on ease of use and automation, tailored to reduce the
                administrative burden on social workers. The platform is divided into two main modules: Case Management
                and
                Social Support Program Management, each serving a specific purpose in streamlining workflows.</p>

                        <li><strong>Case Management Module:</strong> This module is split into three tabs:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Case Profile Tab:</strong> Social workers create and store essential client
                                information, which is reused across applications, minimizing repetitive data entry.</li>
                            <li><strong>Case Background Tab:</strong> Captures detailed background information, such as
                                income and education, feeding into the platform’s recommendation system. The
                                recommendation engine analyzes past cases to suggest programs most likely to succeed
                                based on similar case histories.</li>
                            <li><strong>Application Record Tab:</strong> Tracks the history of all applications,
                                including dates, programs applied to, and outcomes, providing a clear view of each
                                case's progress.</li>

        <!-- Original Content -->
        <p>The project was implemented using a full-stack approach, centered around building a robust, scalable platform. The development
            process was independently led from start to finish, including pitching the concept to NGOs, designing the
            system’s architecture, coding, testing, and final deployment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Front-End:</strong> Vue.js was chosen for its reactive nature and ease of integration, providing
                a seamless, responsive user interface for social workers. Its component-based architecture also ensures
                future updates can be implemented smoothly without disrupting existing functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Back-End:</strong> Java was used to ensure a stable and secure environment for managing the
                platform’s core logic. The robustness and reliability of Java allow the platform to handle a large
                number of concurrent users and complex case workflows with minimal downtime.</li>
            <li><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL was implemented to handle relational data, ensuring efficient data
                storage and retrieval. Its scalability and support for complex queries make it well-suited for managing
                the growing volume of case and program data within the platform.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>These features aim to enhance the platform’s collaborative and informative functions, improving overall
                efficiency and support delivery.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Original Content -->
        <div class="original-content-future">
            <p>As Dream Support evolves, we are planning several key features for Phase 2, aimed at expanding the
                platform’s functionality and fostering greater collaboration between social workers and NGOs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chatbot for Social Issues:</strong> A chatbot will provide instant responses to questions
                    related to social issues, particularly in the realm of poverty. This tool will serve as a quick
                    reference for social workers, offering them tailored, field-specific information to better assist
                    their clients. While developing a comprehensive and accurate answer pool will take time, the chatbot
                    is expected to significantly enhance the resources available to social workers by delivering useful,
                    contextually relevant responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Ticketing Hub:</strong> A ticketing feature will be introduced to
                    facilitate better collaboration among NGOs within the LearningFromThePoor alliance. Social workers
                    will be able to raise tickets for cases requiring extra support, whether it's resource-related or
                    handling a particularly challenging case. Other groups within the alliance can accept these tickets,
                    promoting a cooperative environment where resources and expertise can be shared efficiently. The
                    ticketing system will be flexible, allowing social workers to categorize and tag their requests.
                    These tickets will also serve as valuable internal data for future analysis, helping NGOs understand
                    trends in case needs and resource allocation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These upcoming features will enhance Dream Support's role as both a management tool and a collaborative
                platform, ensuring that social workers have the tools and support they need to deliver the most
                impactful care.</p>

        <h2>Closing</h2>
        <p>Dream Support has significantly eased the administrative burden on social workers, allowing them to
            dedicate more time to direct case support. By automating form generation and offering data-driven
            recommendations, the platform
            has transformed how NGOs manage cases, resulting in improved outcomes for clients.</p>
        <p>Looking into the future, Phase 2 will introduce the Support Ticketing Hub and chatbot, enhancing
            collaboration between
            NGOs and
            providing instant access to tailored information. With these features, Dream Support is well-positioned to
            scale and continue to drive meaningful improvements to meet growing needs across the NGO network.</p>
